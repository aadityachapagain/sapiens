# The Plague


Like the usual day, Juho start his day with coffee and getting ready for the office.The time of departure , he gives his fiancé a sweet kiss, "Remembering, Today is the day of New beginning". "Although he could stay at home and support his fiancé for a Labour, but work is just too important to left and money is certainly huge especially with new family member" he thinks. He lives in a ordinary town lior in the coast with ordinary people and ordinary life.

Its 6:00 PM, and The time of his child, but he barely remembers, he leads nickle counting life so much that he is barely alive or has no emotions, fear and feeling of sorrow and unaware that he became nickle making machine himself. He got number of calls in his cellphone, but he is what he is, he rarely focus on cellphone. His phone keep ringing too much, he notices and decides to pick it up. It was the doctor, he has the news and wants him in the hospital.He steadily moves to the hospital  and finds out his fiancé and unborn child were dead due to birth complications. Suddenly he became very quiet and still.

The moment where fabric of his existence splits open, he keep serching for the truth inside him, He no longer communicate,physically he is the same person he was a while ago, but he is standing still in the same floor for more than hours now, no body movements, no reactions, heartrate still fine and eyes still wide but brain activity beyond the chart. Thus he became infinity. For him, now even small and simpliest seeming  of things become strange and confusing A tree, chair, people, world , other people behaviors, own behavior , job, purpose of life , death and so on and begans to question as to what they are and why they are. This moment becames more than just a moment, becomes inescapable perspective. He starting to recall what he was taught in his mid-school and starts to dismiss the meaning of life given by religious doctrine "Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs". He said "Did  My unborn child do any wrongs ?". He was barely alive and he was killed.


People of the Lior ( the city of future ), becames so much obsessed with thier fame, status, nickle that they reject all the worldy pleasure and ideas. People almost forget their possibillity  of extermination by anything like  Bacillus, an accident or by the actions of fellow humans. People of the Lior assumed that they have been granted immortality and with this naivety comes abhorred behaviour: a hardness in heart, an obsession with status, refusal of joy and gratitude, a tendency to moralise and judge. The People of Lior associates the death with backward, that belongs to another ages. When it comes to dying, there is no progress in history, there is no escape from frailty. Being alive always was and will always remain an emergency `truly an inescapable disarray`, The susceptiblity to sudden death, an event that can render our lives instantaneously meaningless and Yet still the citizen deny.

That is why we need to love our fellow damned humans and work without hope or despair for the amelioration of suffereing. Life was never the idea of status, fame, money, logic or resoning. It is the way always has been `simply living and loving`.

After hearing of death of mother and unborn child, The Priest comes in and seeks to explain it as a god's punishment for depravity. But Doctor in hospital who is looking into patients for his entire life loathes this approch, The death is not a punishment for anything deserved. That would be to imagine that the universe was moral or had some sort of design to it. But doctor watches a young innocent and unborn child die in his hospital and certainly knows better. Suffering is entirely randomly distributed, it makes no sense, it is no ethical force, and it is simply stupid. And it is that stupidness of life that bring joy, happiness and every wordly experience think of it as nature, the sunsine, the cool breeze, friendship, relationship, food and so on.
