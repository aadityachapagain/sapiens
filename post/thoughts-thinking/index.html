<p><code>&quot;Cogito ergo sum.&quot;</code> Famous Latin phrase stated by French philosopher René Descartes. Translated into English which means &ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&rdquo; This phrase actually hold profound philosophical idea, and is argued for centuries by many famous philosophers around the world : <code>we exist, and we are aware that we exist, because we think</code>. Without thought or ability to think , we cease to exist. Even though, if you think Descartes got it wrong, most would say that thought is intimately connected to being human and that,as humans, we are all thinking being.
Thought as result of Thinking is mental process we use to construct concept about the world in a way that seems comfortable with us. When we think, we manipulate information to construct a abstract, to engage in problem-solving, to reason, and to make decisions.</p>
<h1 id="thinking">Thinking</h1>
<p>Thinking is the mental process of constructing thoughts, which is trained and shaped because of million years of human evolution. The way we thought today, is linked by how our ancestors reacted to the certain circumstances that kept them alive and able to survive unforgiving and harsh situations.</p>
<h2 id="sapiens-starlight">Sapiens Starlight</h2>
<p>The major upgrade in cognition began about 70,000 years ago in sapiens , when the ancient humans started talking about things that existed only in their imagination and This Imaginative superpower became our new age of reality.As ancient humans grow their senses and power of creating things in their heads, they slowly understand the concept of corporations, then the first human community formed with the names of GOD. The ability to create something to believe on and work together help us survive countless of things. Like today&rsquo;s corporations, ancient gods were also legal entities that own property, lend money, hire employees, and initiate economic enterprises.</p>
<p>Few Thousands years ago, People of Nile Valley went a step further , merging a living ruler or creator of god to create a living deity - Pharaoh. The Egyptians considered Pharaoh to be a actual god rather than just a divine deputy. The Whole of egypt belong to that god and all people has to obey his orders and pay taxes he levied. Same god that created bureaucrats traps also saved million of lives by gathering workers for building dams, farms and many more. Hence the first division of labor was started by GOD rather than human it self. Thats why the concept of God, brands outperform the concept of individualist, which helps us survive many thousands of generations.</p>
