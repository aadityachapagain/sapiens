      <description>Thoughts &amp;quot;Cogito ergo sum.&amp;quot; Famous Latin phrase stated by French philosopher Ren√© Descartes. Translated into English which means &amp;ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&amp;rdquo; This phrase actually hold profound philosophical idea, and is argued for centuries by many famous philosophers around the world : we exist, and we are aware that we exist, because we think. Without thought or ability to think , we cease to exist. Even though, if you think Descartes got it wrong, most would say that thought is intimately connected to being human and that,as humans, we are all thinking being.</description>
